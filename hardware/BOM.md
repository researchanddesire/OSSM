# Bill of Materials

Edit `hardware/bom.csv` using the canonical 12-column RAD BOM format. This CSV is
the source of truth for OHAI’s BOM. Assembly documentation reaches OHAI through
reviewed sync PRs on the matching staging or main branch.

Keep harnesses as top-level assemblies; detailed cable parts stay WireViz-owned.
The Notes prefixes `Actuator.`, `Extrusion stand.` and `Electronics.` select OHAI
sections. Parts without a prefix appear under Other parts.

`assembly-docs/_bom/bom.csv`, `source.json` and `bom.json` are generated snapshots.
Change the hardware CSV rather than those copies; regenerate them together and
pin the commit containing the CSV. The source-aware hub importer automates this
step once deployed.
